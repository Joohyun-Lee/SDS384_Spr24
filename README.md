# Correlation between several cosmological quantities using a machine learning model based on cosmological simulation data

# Yuxuan Cao, Kaile Wang, Saiyang Zhang, Joohyun Lee


## Goals
Study the correlation between SMBH merger history and DM halo merger history, i.e. rebuild SMBH growth history from host halo merger history + their properties

### Models to be used: 
regression(e.g. multi-variate), classification (e.g. random forest), machine learning

### Variables in the problem:
#### Dependent : 
- BH Merger rate(host halo properties, BH properties)
- BH Merger mass ratio(host halo properties, BH properties)
#### Independent: 
- Host halo properties: host merger rate, host merger mass ratio, mass, spin, central density, maximum rotation velocity, …
- BH properties: chirp mass, spin angle, mass, velocity, …

## Data description
- One of the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation
- Helps to understand when and how galaxies evolve into the structures that are observed
